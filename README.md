### Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project: Provide Business Insights for Company Strategy 2020
#### Objective
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that need to build the strategy for the new online video service. I have worked with the BI department to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments could have.
 
 #### Key Questions
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
- What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
-	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
-	Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
-	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

#### Data Set
The data set contained information about Rockbuster’s film inventory, customers, and payments, among other things. 
- It’s around 3MB and contains several files
- The dataset is available [here Rockbuster data set](http://www.postgresqltutorial.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/dvdrental.zip)
