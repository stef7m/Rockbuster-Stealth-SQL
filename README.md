### Rockbuster Stealth Data Analysis Project: Provide Business Insights for Company Strategy 2020
Rockbuster Stealth LLC is a movie rental company that need to build the strategy for the new online video service. I have worked with the BI department to load all of Rockbusterâ€™s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, I used SQL to analyze the data and answer any ad-hoc business questions that other departments could have.
 
- Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain? 
- What was the average rental duration for all videos? 
-	Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in? 
-	Where are customers with a high lifetime value based? 
-	Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?
